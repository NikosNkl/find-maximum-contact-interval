A python script to find the maximum interval time between spacecraft and ground stations, based on FreeFlyer output data. It takes a .txt file with FreeFlyer data as input and produces two .txt files: one with the contacts in increasing order (based on the timestamps) and one with the contact intervals in increasing order.
